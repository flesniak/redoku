    This is an example illustrating the use of the deep learning tools from the
    dlib C++ Library.  In it, we will train the venerable LeNet convolutional
    neural network to recognize hand written digits.  The network will take as
    input a small image and classify it as one of the 10 numeric digits between
    0 and 9.

    The specific network we will run is from the paper
        LeCun, Yann, et al. "Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition."
        Proceedings of the IEEE 86.11 (1998): 2278-2324.
    except that we replace the sigmoid non-linearities with rectified linear units.

    These tools will use CUDA and cuDNN to drastically accelerate network
    training and testing.  CMake should automatically find them if they are
    installed and configure things appropriately.  If not, the program will
    still run but will be much slower to execute.

    // definition.  The loss layer, a bunch of computational layers, and then an input
    // layer.  You can see these components in the network definition below.
    //
    // The input layer here says the network expects to be given matrix<unsigned char>
    // objects as input.  In general, you can use any dlib image or matrix type here, or
    // even define your own types by creating custom input layers.
    //
    // Then the middle layers define the computation the network will do to transform the
    // input into whatever we want.  Here we run the image through multiple convolutions,
    // ReLU units, max pooling operations, and then finally a fully connected layer that
    // converts the whole thing into just 10 numbers.
    //
    // Finally, the loss layer defines the relationship between the network outputs, our 10
    // numbers, and the labels in our dataset.  Since we selected loss_multiclass_log it
    // means we want to do multiclass classification with our network.   Moreover, the
    // number of network outputs (i.e. 10) is the number of possible labels.  Whichever
    // network output is largest is the predicted label.  So for example, if the first
